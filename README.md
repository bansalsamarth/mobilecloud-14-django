Django examples for the Coursera Course Programming Cloud Services for Android Handheld Systems

1. For code snippet of examples from Week 2, that is, implementation of 'Echo' and 'Video' Service, go to week2/views.py
2. If you have django installed, clone the repo and run this command: python manage.py runserver

By default, django runs the server on Port 8000. The URL's are same as in the course. 

a) localhost/1-SimpleServlet/echo?msg=yourmsg

b) localhost/2-VideoServlet/video - Send a post request to this URL with name, url and duration as request parameters.
